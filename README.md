# Open6022-QT
Open Source software for the Hantek 6022BL DSO written in QT

This is an Open Source software written in QT that let you use Hantek cheap 6022BL Oscilloscope on Mac/Linux machines.

I started from the libraries written by rpm2003 for Mac (based on libusb) and then written my code around them.
